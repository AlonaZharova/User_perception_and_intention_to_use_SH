## Summary 

The positive impact of Smart Homes on energy efficiency is heavily dependent on how consumers use the system after adoption. While the technical aspects of Smart Home systems and their potential to reduce energy usage is a focus of various studies, there is a limited consideration of behavioral psychology while designing systems for energy management. To investigate users’ perception and intention to use Smart Homes to support energy efficiency, we design a research model by combining a theory of planned behavior and the norm activation model. We design a questionnaire and conduct a survey targeting current smart home users (over 350 responses received). To analyze the survey results, we extend the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) by a random forest algorithm. The findings suggest that personal norms have the strongest influence on behavioral intention to use Smart Homes for energy efficiency, followed by the ascription of responsibility. Furthermore, the results support the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, awareness of consequences, as well as the moderating effect of past behavior on the relationship between personal norms and behavioral intentions.
